- `standard_figures`: Images and diagrams within sections
- Supporting tables for keywords, notes, bookmarks, and educational resources

### API Endpoints
Key endpoints implemented:
- `/api/standards`: Get list of available standards
- `/api/standards/:id`: Get specific standard details
- `/api/standards/:standardId/sections`: Get sections for a standard
- `/api/sections/:id`: Get section details with tables and figures
- `/api/search/sections`: Search standards content
- `/api/lookup/illumination`: Special endpoint for illumination requirements lookup

### Client Components
- `StandardsReference.tsx`: Main component with tabbed interface
