# Energy Audit Module Implementation for UCLM

This document outlines the implementation plan and progress for the Energy Audit module at the University of Cebu-Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue (UCLM).

## Project Overview

The Energy Audit module is designed to optimize energy efficiency and power quality through a web-based audit platform. This implementation follows the four-phase framework outlined in the thesis:

1. **Survey & Inspection** - Assessment of the existing electrical system
2. **Standards Assessment** - Compliance checking with PEC 2017 and Energy Management Handbook (7th Ed.)
3. **Tool Development & Testing** - Creation of web-based audit tools
4. **Impact Evaluation & Acceptance** - Evaluation of the system's effectiveness

## Key Components

### 1. Building Visualization
- 3D model of the UCLM Old Building with floor-by-floor visualization
- Electrical system mapping with interactive elements
- Room-by-room inventory system for electrical components

### 2. Standards Compliance
- PEC 2017 compliance checking for:
  - Wire sizes (PEC Article 3)
  - Protection devices (PEC Article 2.40)
  - Electrical outlets (PEC Article 3.0.1.14-15)
  - Lighting systems (PEC Article 3)
- Energy Management Handbook (7th Ed.) compliance checking
- Risk assessment framework with:
  - Probability of Occurrences
  - Severity of Occurrences
  - Risk Severity
  - Assessment Risk Index

### 3. Energy Consumption Analytics
- Real-time energy monitoring
- Historical data analysis
- Trend identification and visualization
- Energy usage patterns by floor/area

### 4. Anomaly Detection
- AI-powered detection of abnormal energy patterns
- Alert system for potential issues
- Historical anomaly tracking

### 5. AI Recommendations
- Energy conservation measures
- Prioritized recommendations based on ROI
- Implementation guidance

### 6. Predictive Maintenance
- Equipment failure prediction
- Maintenance scheduling optimization
- Cost-benefit analysis for maintenance decisions

### 7. Mobile Field Data Collection
- Offline-capable data collection forms
- Photo documentation capabilities
- Geolocation tagging
- Automatic synchronization

### 8. Audit Workflow Management
- Task assignment and tracking
- Progress monitoring
- Approval workflows
- Collaboration tools

### 9. ROI Calculator
- Financial analysis of energy conservation measures
- Payback period calculation
- Comparison of different implementation scenarios
- Budget planning tools

### 10. Benchmarking
- Comparison with industry standards
- Building-to-building comparison
- Historical performance tracking
- Goal setting and progress monitoring

### 11. Report Generator
- Customizable report templates
- Compliance documentation
- Executive summaries
- Detailed technical reports

### 12. Integration Hub
- Connection with existing building management systems
- IoT device integration
- Data import/export capabilities
- API access for third-party tools

## Implementation Progress

| Component | Status | Notes |

| Energy Audit Checklist | Completed | Implemented comprehensive checklist based on PEC 2017 standards with risk assessment framework |

## Risk Assessment Framework

The implementation includes the risk assessment framework from the thesis:

### Probability of Occurrences
- 1 - Rare (Once per year)
- 2 - Unlikely (Several times per year)
- 3 - Possible (Monthly)
- 4 - Likely (Weekly)
- 5 - Almost Certain (Daily)

### Severity of Occurrences
- A - Insignificant (No injury, low financial loss)
- B - Minor (First aid treatment, medium financial loss)
- C - Moderate (Medical treatment required, high financial loss)
- D - Major (Extensive injuries, major financial loss)
- E - Catastrophic (Death, huge financial loss)

### Risk Severity
- Low (1-4) - Acceptable risk
- Medium (5-9) - Needs attention
- High (10-15) - Urgent action required
- Extreme (16-25) - Immediate action required

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete the Building Visualization component with electrical mapping
2. ✅ Implement Energy Audit Checklist based on PEC 2017 standards
3. Finalize Energy Consumption Analytics with real-time data
4. Implement Anomaly Detection system
5. Develop AI Recommendations engine
6. Complete Mobile Field Data Collection with offline capabilities
7. Enhance Audit Workflow Management with approval processes
8. Finalize Benchmarking with industry standards
9. Implement Integration Hub for IoT and third-party systems
