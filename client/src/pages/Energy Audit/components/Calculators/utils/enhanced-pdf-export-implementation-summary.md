# Enhanced PDF Export Implementation Summary

## Recent Implementations (Schedule of Loads Calculator)

### 1. Multi-Panel Support in PDF Export
We've enhanced the Schedule of Loads PDF export system to support multiple panels in a single comprehensive report. Key features include:

- **Table of Contents**: Automatically generates a TOC showing all panels included in the report
- **Executive Summary**: Provides aggregated statistics across all panels including:
  - Total connected load
  - Number of circuits
  - Phase balance statistics
  - Compliance rate
  - Panel breakdown with load distribution chart
- **Panel Divider Pages**: Clear separation between panels with summary information
- **Consistent Analysis Sections**: Each panel includes consistent analysis sections:
  - Load distribution visualization
  - Voltage drop analysis
  - Phase balance analysis (for 3-phase panels)
  - Compliance summary with PEC 2017 reference
  - Economic sizing analysis

### 2. Schedule of Loads Calculator Improvements
We've addressed several user-reported issues with the Schedule of Loads calculator:

- **Save Calculation Button**: Added a dedicated Save Calculation button in the toolbar
- **Dropdown Selections**: Implemented proper dropdown selectors for:
  - Circuit breaker sizes (using CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPTIONS)
  - Conductor sizes (using CONDUCTOR_SIZE_OPTIONS)
- **Auto-Recalculation**: Improved the input handlers to automatically recalculate values when inputs change
- **Saved Calculations Integration**: Connected to the unified saved calculations system for consistent user experience

### 3. Technical Improvements
- **Fixed Type Safety**: Resolved TypeScript errors in the PDF export system
- **Project Info Interface**: Created a standardized ProjectInfo interface for consistent project documentation
- **Helper Functions**: Added utility functions for creating visualization elements in PDF:
  - drawPieChart: Creates pie charts for load distribution
  - drawChartLegend: Adds properly formatted legends
  - calculateTotalConnectedLoad: Computes aggregated load values

## Next Steps

### 1. UI Integration for Multi-Panel Support
- Implement UI controls for selecting multiple panels to export
- Create a panel manager component to view/select available panels
- Add capability to reorder panels in the export

### 2. Further Schedule of Loads Enhancements
- Complete circuit breaker size recommendation system
- Implement automatic conductor sizing based on load requirements
- Add batch analysis for economic sizing across all circuits
- Implement typical load presets library for faster data entry

### 3. Extend Enhanced PDF Export to Other Calculators
- Apply the enhanced PDF export system to other calculators:
  - Lighting Calculator
  - HVAC Calculator
  - Power Factor Calculator
  - Harmonic Distortion Calculator
- Create a unified PDF export service for consistent implementation

### 4. Advanced PDF Features
- Implement customizable report sections
- Add user-configurable branding elements
- Implement batch export capabilities for multiple calculators
- Create comparison visualizations for before/after analysis

## Implementation Priority
1. Complete the UI integration for multi-panel support
2. Implement batch sizing optimization for all circuits
3. Add typical load presets library for faster data entry
4. Extend enhanced PDF export to other calculators
