## Components Implemented

### Linked Charts
The `LinkedChartsExample` component demonstrates how multiple charts can be linked together, where interactions with one chart (like clicking on a pie chart segment) automatically update other related charts. This provides a comprehensive and coordinated view of energy data.

Key features include:
- Interactive filtering through UI controls (year range, efficiency threshold, category selection)
- Four linked charts (pie, doughnut, bar, and horizontal bar) that all respond to the same data changes
- Dynamic insights panel that updates based on selected categories
- Comprehensive data generation based on selected filters

### Chart Filtering Controls
The `ChartFilterControls` component adds filtering capabilities to any chart, providing users with the ability to customize their view of the data.

Key features include:
- Dataset visibility toggles with color-coded checkboxes
- Value range filtering with customizable sliders
- Support for filter presets that can be saved and applied
- Flexible positioning options (top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left)
- Proper UI feedback when filters are applied

### Custom Tooltips
The `CustomTooltips` component enables rich, informative tooltips for chart data points, providing users with extended context and insights.

Key features include:
- Support for both HTML-based and native Chart.js tooltips
- Rich contextual information including details, comparisons, trends, and recommendations
- Year-over-year and historical average comparisons
- Dynamic recommendations based on data analysis
- Consistent styling with customization options

## Technical Notes

### Chart.js Integration
- Uses Chart.js as the underlying charting library
- Extends Chart.js with custom plugins and functionality
- Implements custom tooltip handlers for enhanced data display
- Integrates with Material-UI for consistent styling and theming

### Accessibility
- All charts follow WCAG 2.1 AA compliance guidelines
- Screen reader support for data visualization
- Keyboard navigation for interactive elements
- Alternative data table views for non-visual access to information

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized rendering for complex visualizations
- Debounced event handlers for better performance
- Responsive design for various device sizes and orientations
