# Compliance Checker System Documentation

## Overview

The Compliance Checker System enables users to verify compliance with electrical standards and regulations by creating and managing checklists based on compliance rules defined from standards. This feature complements the Standards Reference System by providing a structured way to validate that installations and designs meet required code specifications.

## Key Features

- **Rules Management**: Create, update, and manage compliance rules derived from standards
- **Checklist Creation**: Generate checklists from selected compliance rules
- **Compliance Verification**: Track check status (passed/failed/pending)
- **Evidence Collection**: Attach evidence to verify compliance status
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate reports showing compliance status

## System Architecture

The Compliance Checker System consists of the following components:

### 1. Data Model

- **Compliance Rules**: Derived from standard sections, defining specific requirements to check
- **Compliance Checklists**: Collections of rules grouped for specific verification purposes
- **Compliance Checks**: Individual verifications of rules within a checklist

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Rules Management
- `GET /api/compliance/rules` - List all compliance rules
- `GET /api/compliance/rules/:id` - Get details for a specific rule
- `POST /api/compliance/rules` - Create a new compliance rule
- `PUT /api/compliance/rules/:id` - Update an existing rule
- `DELETE /api/compliance/rules/:id` - Delete a rule or mark it inactive

#### Checklist Management
- `GET /api/compliance/checklists` - List all checklists
- `GET /api/compliance/checklists/:id` - Get checklist details with all its checks
- `POST /api/compliance/checklists` - Create a new checklist
- `PUT /api/compliance/checklists/:id/status` - Update checklist status

#### Check Management

## Using the Compliance System

### For Administrators

1. **Creating Compliance Rules**:
   - Navigate to the Compliance Rules management section
   - Click "Add Rule" to create a new rule
   - Select the standard section that contains the requirement
   - Define the rule details (title, description, criteria, etc.)
   - Set the severity level and verification method
   - Save the rule

2. **Managing Rules**:
   - View all rules in a filterable, sortable table
   - Edit rules as standards or requirements change
   - Deactivate outdated rules
   - Tag rules by category for easier organization

### For Auditors

1. **Creating a Compliance Checklist**:
   - Go to the Checklists section
   - Click "New Checklist"
   - Provide a name and description
   - Select rules to include in the checklist
   - Save to create the checklist in "draft" status

2. **Performing Compliance Checks**:
   - Open the checklist
   - For each rule:
     - Review the requirement and verification method
     - Perform the necessary checks
     - Mark as "passed", "failed", or "not applicable"
     - Add notes about the verification
     - Attach evidence (photos, measurements, etc.)
   - When all checks are complete, the checklist can be set to "active"

3. **Generating Reports**:
   - View compliance summary statistics
   - Generate PDF reports showing compliance status
   - Filter reports to focus on failed items or by severity

## Rule Types

The system supports three types of compliance rules:

1. **Mandatory**: Requirements that must be met (non-negotiable)
2. **Prescriptive**: Specific methods or solutions that must be implemented
3. **Performance**: Requirements focused on outcomes rather than specific methods

## Severity Levels

Rules are categorized by severity:

1. **Critical**: Issues that pose safety risks or significant code violations
2. **Major**: Substantial issues that should be addressed but aren't immediate safety concerns
3. **Minor**: Issues that represent best practices or optimization opportunities

## Integration with Standards Reference

The Compliance Checker System is tightly integrated with the Standards Reference System:

- Rules are linked directly to standard sections
- Standard content can be viewed while performing checks
- Tags applied to standards sections can be used to filter rules
- Search functionality includes compliance rules

## Workflow States

Checklists progress through the following states:

1. **Draft**: Initial creation state, checks can be modified
2. **Active**: All checks completed, represents a finalized verification
3. **Archived**: Historical checklist that is no longer relevant or has been superseded

## Best Practices

1. **Rule Creation**:
   - Write clear, specific descriptions
   - Include precise evaluation criteria
   - Provide remediation advice for failed checks
   - Link to relevant external resources when applicable

2. **Checklist Usage**:
   - Create focused checklists for specific purposes rather than catchall lists
   - Include additional context in the notes field
   - Attach clear, relevant evidence
   - Include calibration information for measurement devices used

3. **Reporting**:
   - Focus on critical and major findings first
   - Include remediation plans for failed items
   - Track compliance improvements over time

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the Compliance Checker System include:

1. Automated checks based on calculation results
2. Mobile-friendly interface for field verification
3. Compliance trends and analytics
4. Integration with project management tools for remediation tracking
5. AI-assisted compliance verification suggestions
