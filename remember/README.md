## Thesis Summary
The thesis "OPTIMIZING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND POWER QUALITY THROUGH A WEB-BASED AUDIT PLATFORM" addresses the challenges of energy management in buildings, particularly in educational institutions. It proposes a web-based platform that enables comprehensive energy audits through:

- Calculation tools for energy consumption analysis
- Power quality assessment mechanisms
- Standards compliance checking
- Interactive visualization of building systems
- ROI and financial analysis tools
- Reporting and recommendation generation

The platform aims to help facility managers identify inefficiencies, ensure compliance with electrical standards (particularly Philippine Electrical Code), and make data-driven decisions for energy optimization.

## Core Focus Areas
