## Completed Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Controller Functionality
- Extended the `complianceVerificationController.js` to support all major calculator types
- Implemented standards-based verification for:
  - Illumination Calculator (PEC 1075)
  - Power Factor Calculator (PEC 2050)
  - Harmonic Distortion Calculator (IEEE 519)
  - Schedule of Loads Calculator (PEC 240)
  - HVAC Calculator (ASHRAE 90.1)
  - Energy Efficiency Calculator (DOE-EE, PGBC)
  - Renewable Energy Calculator (RE-ACT, IEEE 1547)
  - ROI Calculator (Financial benchmarks)
  - Transformer Sizing Calculator (IEEE C57.12, C57.91)
  - Emergency Power System Calculator (NFPA 110)
- Added specialized compliance criteria extraction from standards text
- Implemented building type-specific verification logic for energy efficiency standards
- Added project type-specific financial benchmarking for ROI calculations
- Implemented transformer loading and efficiency verification based on size and type
- Added emergency power system verification based on criticality level and load type

### 2. Database Integration
- Connected with the Standards Reference System for retrieving applicable standards
- Implemented storage of verification results in the database
- Added support for saving detailed rule-by-rule verification results
- Created a system for verification history retrieval

### 3. Technical Features
- Added dynamic thresholds based on calculation parameters
- Implemented numeric value extraction from standards text
- Created specialized status determination logic for each calculator type
- Added support for not applicable rules in certain contexts
- Implemented specific financial parameter verification (ROI, payback, NPV, IRR)
- Added temperature rise and loading factor verification for transformers
- Implemented runtime and transfer time verification for emergency systems

### 4. Frontend Components
- Created `ComplianceResultsCard` component for displaying compliance verification results
- Implemented visual status indicators (passed/failed/needs review)
- Added expandable rule details with requirements and status
- Implemented automatic recommendation generation based on non-compliant rules
- Added PDF export and report integration functionality
- Created responsive design with clear color-coding for status visualization

### 5. Documentation
- Updated implementation progress documentation
- Created comprehensive compliance implementation summary
- Added detailed documentation on calculator compliance requirements
- Created unit tests for the compliance verification controller

## Next Steps

### 1. Frontend Implementation
- Create specialized compliance verification result components for specific calculator types
- Implement detailed compliance report interface
- Add remediation guidance display for non-compliant results

### 2. Standards Database Integration
- Replace hardcoded standards values with database-driven values
- Implement dynamic standard lookup based on building type and other parameters
- Add support for standard version selection

### 3. Reporting Integration
- Connect compliance verification results with the report generator
- Add compliance summary section to generated reports
- Create exportable compliance verification certificates

### 4. Advanced Features
- Implement compliance-based recommendations
- Add prioritized remediation advice
- Create compliance history tracking and trending
- Add visual compliance mapping in building visualization

## Implementation Timeline

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Integrate compliance components with calculator views
2. Replace hardcoded standards values with database queries
3. Connect compliance results with the existing report system

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)
1. Integrate compliance results with report generator
2. Add detailed remediation guidance
3. Create database schema for standards values

### Long-term (2-3 Months)
1. Implement compliance-based recommendations system
2. Add compliance history tracking and trending
3. Create visual compliance mapping in building visualization

## Technical Debt
1. Improve test coverage for all compliance verification functions
2. Refactor extraction functions for better flexibility and accuracy
3. Optimize database queries for retrieving standards
4. Implement caching for frequently used standards

## Known Issues
1. Hardcoded standards values need to be replaced with database values
2. Some verification logic is calculator-specific and could be generalized
3. Unit tests need to be implemented for all helper functions
4. Performance optimization needed for handling large rule sets
