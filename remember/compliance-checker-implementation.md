## Usage Flow

1. **Creating Rules**
   - Navigate to the "Compliance" tab in Standards Reference
   - Select the "Rules" tab
   - Create rules based on standard sections
   - Specify severity, type, and verification methods

2. **Creating Checklists**
   - Navigate to the "Checklists" tab
   - Create a new checklist
   - Select rules to include
   - Save as draft

3. **Performing Checks**
   - Select a checklist to view details
   - For each rule, review requirements and verify compliance
   - Mark as passed, failed, or not applicable
   - Add notes and evidence
   - Save status

4. **Verifying Calculator Results**
   - Use any calculator to perform energy calculations
   - Save the calculation
   - Navigate to the "Compliance Verification" tab in Energy Calculators
   - Select a saved calculation
   - Review compliance status against applicable standards
   - View detailed rule validation and recommendations
   - Results are automatically saved to the database if user is authenticated

5. **Generating Reports**
   - Navigate to the "Reports" tab
   - View compliance statistics
   - Export reports as needed

## Integration Points

- Connected to Standards Reference system for rule creation
- Integrated with user authentication for tracking
- Connected with calculator components for automatic verification
- Prepared for integration with PDF generation system
- Database integration for persistent storage of verification results

## Calculator Integration Details

The calculator integration provides automatic compliance checking for:

1. **Illumination Calculations**
   - Automatically checks calculated illuminance against PEC Rule 1075 requirements
   - Verifies room-specific illumination levels based on space type
   - Provides pass/fail status with specific details on compliance gaps

2. **Power Factor Calculations**
   - Verifies power factor values against PEC requirements (minimum 0.90)
   - Identifies non-compliant power factor values
   - Provides remediation advice for improving power factor

3. **Harmonic Distortion Calculations**
   - Verifies THD values against IEEE-519 standards
   - Checks for compliance with harmonic distortion limits
   - Provides detailed feedback on non-compliant harmonics

4. **Schedule of Loads Calculations**
   - Verifies load calculations against PEC requirements
   - Checks transformer capacity utilization
   - Validates compliance with loading standards

5. **Other Calculators**
   - Framework implemented for all calculator types
   - Rule matching based on calculation type
   - Status tracking (compliant, non-compliant, needs review)
   - Persistence of verification results in the database

## Database Schema Details

1. **calculation_compliance_verifications Table**
   - Stores high-level verification information
   - Tracks calculation ID, user ID, and overall status
   - Maintains counters for compliant, non-compliant, and review items
   - Implements timestamps for tracking verification history

2. **calculation_compliance_details Table**
   - Stores detailed rule verification results
   - Links to specific rules and verification records
   - Tracks individual compliance status per rule
   - Stores detailed verification messages and explanations

## Next Steps
