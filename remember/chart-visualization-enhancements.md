# Chart Visualization Enhancements

## Current Implementation (Completed)
We have successfully implemented chart visualization in the PDF reports using Chart.js:

### 1. Chart Types Implemented
- ✅ **Bar Charts** - Used for comparing values across categories
  - Energy consumption comparison
  - Cost analysis
  - Before/after efficiency upgrades
- ✅ **Pie Charts** - Used for showing distribution
  - Equipment energy distribution
  - Cost allocation by equipment type
- ✅ **Line Charts** - Used for trend analysis
  - Harmonic spectrum visualization
  - Multiple data series comparison
- ✅ **Comparison Charts** - Used for before/after analysis
  - Current vs. LED lighting comparisons
  - Power factor correction comparisons
  - System efficiency comparisons

### 2. Integration with Reports
- ✅ **Lighting Report** - Energy consumption and LED comparison visualization
- ✅ **HVAC Report** - System efficiency comparison and cost analysis charts
- ✅ **Equipment Report** - Energy distribution pie charts and cost breakdowns
- ✅ **Power Factor Report** - Power triangle visualization and ROI projections
- ✅ **Harmonic Distortion Report** - Spectrum analysis and compliance visualization

### 3. Technical Implementation
- ✅ Asynchronous chart rendering using Promises
- ✅ Canvas element creation and management
- ✅ Data URL generation for PDF embedding
- ✅ Proper cleanup of DOM elements
- ✅ Fixed linter issues by removing unused imports
