Total estimated time to complete all remaining tasks: **4-6 days**

## Conclusion

The Circuit Synchronization System now provides a robust foundation for maintaining consistency between the Voltage Drop Calculator and Schedule of Loads Calculator. With the successful implementation of both the Voltage Drop Calculator and Schedule of Loads integrations, we have established a complete bidirectional synchronization system.

The SynchronizationPanel component provides users with visibility into the synchronization status and control over the process, while the SyncHistoryDialog allows tracking and filtering of synchronization events. The conflict resolution features help users manage discrepancies between different data sources.

With the comprehensive enhancements to the sync history system, users can now:
- View and filter a complete history of all synchronization events
- Export event history to CSV for further analysis
- Filter events by type, source, date range, and search terms
- Navigate through large event lists with pagination
- Visualize sync event trends over time with the timeline chart

Visual indicators in the Schedule of Loads interface clearly show which circuit items are synchronized with the Voltage Drop Calculator, and users can analyze load items with the Voltage Drop Calculator directly from the Schedule of Loads interface.

The next priority is to enhance the conflict resolution features and add comprehensive documentation and testing. With these additions, the system will provide an even more comprehensive solution for maintaining consistent circuit data across different calculators.
