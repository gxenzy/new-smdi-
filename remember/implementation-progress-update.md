# Chart Accessibility Implementation Progress Update

## Recently Completed Tasks

We have made significant progress on chart accessibility implementation:

### 1. Comprehensive Chart Accessibility Test Suite

- Created `ChartAccessibilityTestSuite.tsx` component that provides a complete testing environment for chart accessibility
- Implemented support for testing multiple chart types (bar, line, pie, doughnut, radar, scatter)
- Added tabbed interface for test configuration, results, screen reader output, and test history
- Integrated with axe-core for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
- Created detailed test report generation functionality
- Implemented test history tracking feature
- Added route `/settings/accessibility/test-suite` for accessing the test suite

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation

- Created detailed documentation for the chart accessibility test suite in `chart-accessibility-test-suite-documentation.md`
- Developed an accessibility testing checklist in `chart-accessibility-testing-checklist.md`
- Created a developer guide for implementing accessible charts in `developer-guide-accessible-charts.md`
- Added a screen reader testing guide in `screen-reader-testing-guide.md`
- Updated `chart-accessibility-next-steps.md` to reflect current progress

### 3. Implementation Planning for Advanced Keyboard Navigation

- Created a detailed implementation plan for keyboard navigation features in `keyboard-navigation-implementation-plan.md`
- Designed a keyboard navigation manager component/hook
- Outlined chart type-specific navigation logic
- Specified visual focus indicator implementation
- Designed keyboard shortcut overlay component
- Planned focus management system for complex chart interactions

### 4. To-Do List Updates

- Updated the to-do list to mark completed items
- Added new prioritized items for advanced keyboard navigation implementation
- Created a structured timeline for keyboard navigation feature implementation
- Added success criteria for testing the accessibility features

## Next Steps

The highest priority items for the next implementation phase are:

1. **Implement Keyboard Navigation Hook**
   - Create the `useChartKeyboardNavigation` hook
   - Implement chart type-specific navigation logic
   - Add keyboard event handling for chart components

2. **Create Visual Focus Indicators**
   - Implement `highlightFocusedElement` utility
   - Add focus styles that work across different chart types
   - Ensure indicators meet WCAG standards for focus visibility

3. **Build Keyboard Shortcut Help Component**
   - Create `KeyboardShortcutHelp` dialog component
   - Implement shortcut documentation for each chart type
   - Add help trigger via keyboard ('?' key)

4. **Enhance AccessibleChartRenderer**
   - Integrate keyboard navigation hook
   - Add keyboard shortcut support
   - Implement screen reader announcements for keyboard navigation

5. **Create Focus Management System**
   - Implement `ChartFocusManager` class
   - Add focus tracking and restoration
   - Handle complex interactions across chart components

6. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Test all implemented features with keyboard only
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)
   - Update documentation to reflect new features

## Timeline

- Week 1: Implement keyboard navigation hook and chart-specific navigation logic
- Week 2: Implement visual focus indicators and keyboard shortcut help
- Week 3: Update AccessibleChartRenderer and integrate focus management
- Week 4: Testing and refinement

## Additional Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation does not affect chart rendering performance
   - Optimize focus management for complex charts with many data points

2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
   - Test keyboard navigation in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Ensure consistent behavior across browser implementations

3. **Mobile Accessibility**
   - Consider how keyboard navigation interacts with touch interfaces
   - Ensure accessibility features work on mobile devices
