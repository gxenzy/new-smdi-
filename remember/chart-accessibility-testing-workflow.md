1. **Preparation** ‚Üí 2. **Automated Testing** ‚Üí 3. **Manual Testing** ‚Üí 4. **Documentation** ‚Üí 5. **Analysis** ‚Üí 6. **Improvements**

## 1. Preparation

Before starting the testing process, ensure you have:

- Identified which chart types need testing
- Set up the necessary screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, etc.)
- Configured your browser for testing
- Understood the acceptance criteria for accessibility compliance

**Tools to use:**
- AccessibilityTestingDashboard - to get an overview of testing progress
- ChartAccessibilityRoadmap - to see which chart types and screen readers need testing

## 2. Automated Testing

Begin with automated testing to identify basic accessibility issues:

1. Navigate to `/settings/accessibility/test-suite`
2. Select the chart type to test
3. Configure the test parameters
4. Run the automated tests
5. Review the results for violations

**Tools to use:**
- ChartAccessibilityTestSuite - for running automated tests

## 3. Manual Testing

After automated testing, perform manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation:

### Screen Reader Testing

1. Navigate to `/settings/accessibility/testing-guide`
2. Follow the step-by-step guide for your chosen screen reader
3. Test each feature:
   - Chart navigation (arrow keys)
   - Data table view (Alt+D)
   - Summary view (Alt+A)
   - Keyboard help (Alt+H)

### Keyboard-Only Testing

1. Navigate to the chart using Tab key
2. Test navigation with arrow keys
3. Test all keyboard shortcuts
4. Verify focus indicators are visible

**Tools to use:**
- ScreenReaderTestingGuide - for step-by-step screen reader testing instructions

## 4. Documentation

Document all findings using the test recorder:

1. Navigate to `/settings/accessibility/test-recorder`
2. Fill out the test configuration details
3. Document test results for each test case
4. Record any issues found
5. Add recommendations for improvements
6. Save the test report

**Tools to use:**
- ChartAccessibilityTestRecorder - for documenting test results

## 5. Analysis

Analyze test results to identify patterns and prioritize issues:

1. Navigate to `/settings/accessibility/test-reports`
2. Review all test reports
3. Navigate to `/settings/accessibility/test-stats`
4. Analyze test statistics and trends
5. Identify common issues across chart types or screen readers

**Tools to use:**
- ChartAccessibilityTestReports - for viewing test reports
- TestReportManagementTools - for managing and filtering reports
- ChartAccessibilityTestStats - for analyzing test data

## 6. Improvements

Based on analysis, implement improvements:

1. Prioritize issues by severity
2. Implement fixes for critical issues first
3. Re-test after implementing fixes
4. Update test reports with new findings

## Testing Matrix

| Chart Type | NVDA | JAWS | VoiceOver | Keyboard-Only | High Contrast Mode |
|------------|------|------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Bar Chart  |      |      |           |               |                     |
| Line Chart |      |      |           |               |                     |
| Pie Chart  |      |      |           |               |                     |
| Doughnut   |      |      |           |               |                     |
| Radar      |      |      |           |               |                     |
| Scatter    |      |      |           |               |                     |

Use the matrix above to track your testing progress. Mark cells with:
- ‚úÖ (Passed) - All tests passed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è (Issues found) - Some tests failed, but not critical
- ‚ùå (Failed) - Critical issues found
- üîÑ (In progress) - Testing in progress
- ‚ùì (Not tested) - Not yet tested

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Keyboard Navigation Issues**
   - Focus not visible on chart elements
   - Cannot navigate to all data points
   - Cannot access chart controls

2. **Screen Reader Issues**
   - Missing or incorrect ARIA attributes
   - Data points not announced correctly
   - Chart title/description not announced
   - Data table not properly structured

3. **Visual Issues**
   - Insufficient color contrast
   - Reliance on color alone to convey information
   - Patterns not distinguishable in high contrast mode

## Test Report Quality Guidelines

When documenting issues:

1. Be specific about what failed
2. Include exact steps to reproduce
3. Describe both expected and actual behavior
4. Include screen reader output where relevant
5. Suggest potential solutions if possible

## Conclusion

Following this structured testing workflow will ensure that our chart components are thoroughly tested for accessibility. The combination of automated and manual testing, along with careful documentation and analysis, will help identify and prioritize issues for improvement.

Remember that accessibility is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Regular testing and continuous improvement are essential to maintaining accessible data visualizations.
