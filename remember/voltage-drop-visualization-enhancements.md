# Voltage Drop Visualization Enhancements

## Overview

Now that we have successfully implemented the automatic voltage drop recalculation system, our next priority is to enhance the visualization components for voltage drop analysis. These enhancements will provide more detailed and interactive visualizations of voltage drop throughout electrical circuits, helping users better understand the impact of their design decisions.

## Core Visualization Enhancements

### 1. Interactive Voltage Profile Chart

The voltage profile chart will show how voltage drops along the length of a conductor, providing a visual representation of voltage levels at different points in the circuit.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Create a responsive line chart showing voltage levels vs. distance
- Add interactive features like hovering for detailed information
- Implement color-coded regions for compliant vs. non-compliant sections
- Add reference lines for maximum allowable voltage drop
- Implement zoom and pan capabilities for detailed analysis

### 2. Conductor Comparison Visualization

The conductor comparison visualization will allow users to compare different conductor sizes and see the impact on voltage drop.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Create a multi-series line chart for comparing different conductor sizes
- Implement a side-by-side comparison view with key metrics
- Add a cost/benefit analysis for different conductor options
- Create a "recommended size" indicator based on compliance and economic factors
- Implement an interactive selection mechanism for alternative sizes

### 3. Circuit Diagram with Voltage Drop Indicators

Create a visual circuit diagram that shows voltage drop at different points in the circuit.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Implement a basic circuit schematic representation
- Add color-coded voltage indicators at key points
- Create animated visualization of current flow and voltage drop
- Add component-specific details on hover
- Implement highlighting of critical areas

### 4. Compliance Visualization with Standards References

Enhance the compliance reporting with visual indicators and direct links to relevant electrical standards.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Create a visual compliance dashboard with key metrics
- Add detailed references to PEC 2017 standards sections
- Implement a visual "compliance meter" showing margin to limits
- Add educational tooltips explaining compliance requirements
- Create a recommendations panel with visual priority indicators

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Chart Components

We will create a set of specialized chart components for voltage drop visualization:

```typescript
// Voltage Profile Chart
interface VoltageProfileChartProps {
  voltageData: {
    distance: number;
    voltage: number;
    isCompliant: boolean;
  }[];
  maxAllowedDrop: number;
  supplyVoltage: number;
  onPointHover?: (distance: number, voltage: number) => void;
}

// Conductor Comparison Chart
interface ConductorComparisonChartProps {
  conductorSizes: string[];
  comparisonData: {
    size: string;
    voltageDropPercent: number;
    cost: number;
    powerLoss: number;
    isCompliant: boolean;
  }[];
  onSizeSelect?: (size: string) => void;
}

// Circuit Diagram Visualization
interface CircuitDiagramProps {
  circuitData: UnifiedCircuitData;
  voltageDropResults: VoltageDropCalculationResult;
  highlightMode?: 'voltage' | 'current' | 'power';
  onComponentClick?: (component: string) => void;
}
```

### 2. Chart Utilities

We will enhance our chart utilities with specialized functions for voltage drop visualization:

```typescript
// Generate voltage profile data points
function generateVoltageProfileData(
  length: number, 
  current: number,
  resistance: number,
  supplyVoltage: number,
  maxAllowedDrop: number
): VoltageProfileData[];

// Calculate comparison data for different conductor sizes
function generateConductorComparisonData(
  baseCircuitData: UnifiedCircuitData,
  alternativeSizes: string[]
): ConductorComparisonData[];

// Generate circuit diagram representation
function generateCircuitDiagram(
  circuitData: UnifiedCircuitData
): CircuitDiagramData;
```

## Integration Points

### 1. EnhancedVoltageDropAnalysisDialog

Update the EnhancedVoltageDropAnalysisDialog to include the new visualizations:

- Add a new "Visualizations" tab with the enhanced charts
- Implement interactive controls for visualization options
- Add "Show in Circuit Diagram" button for detailed view
- Create a visualization preferences section

### 2. BatchVoltageDropAnalysisDialog

Enhance the BatchVoltageDropAnalysisDialog with summary visualizations:

- Add a batch voltage profile comparison chart
- Implement a panel-wide compliance visualization
- Create a circuit prioritization view based on compliance status
- Add panel load balance visualization with voltage drop impact

### 3. Dashboard Integration

Create a voltage drop monitoring widget for the main dashboard:

- Implement a circuit health visualization
- Add compliance status indicators for all circuits
- Create a "Top Issues" panel highlighting critical concerns
- Add a trend visualization for tracking improvements over time
