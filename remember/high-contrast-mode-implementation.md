# High Contrast Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview

High contrast mode is an essential accessibility feature for users with visual impairments. This document outlines the implementation plan for adding high contrast mode to the Energy Audit Platform.

## Current Status

- ✅ Implemented AccessibilitySettingsContext for global accessibility settings
- ✅ Added high contrast theme definitions for chart rendering
- ✅ Fixed provider hierarchy to ensure proper context access
- ✅ Connected ChartAccessibilityProvider to global AccessibilitySettings
- ✅ Added basic high contrast styling for charts
- ✅ Created UI components for accessibility settings
- ✅ Added global CSS for high contrast mode
- ✅ Added pattern fills to charts using patternomaly library
- ✅ Created example component to demonstrate accessible charts

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Infrastructure (Completed)
- ✅ Create AccessibilitySettingsContext and Provider
- ✅ Implement localStorage persistence for accessibility preferences
- ✅ Define high contrast chart themes
- ✅ Fix provider hierarchy for proper context access

### Phase 2: UI Components and Controls (Completed)
- ✅ Create AccessibilitySettingsPanel component
  - ✅ Add toggle controls for high contrast mode
  - ✅ Add toggle controls for other accessibility features
  - ✅ Implement keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Create accessibility settings modal with keyboard shortcut
- ✅ Create accessibility settings button with indicator badge
- ✅ Integrate accessibility button in application header/footer

### Phase 3: High Contrast Styling (In Progress)
- ✅ Implement global CSS variables for high contrast mode
- ✅ Create high contrast styles for common UI components
- ✅ Add pattern fills to charts using patternomaly library
- [ ] Ensure all components meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
- [ ] Implement focus indicators for high contrast mode

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation (Pending)
- [ ] Test high contrast mode with screen readers
- [ ] Validate contrast ratios using automated tools
- [ ] Create documentation for accessibility features
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for toggling accessibility features
- [ ] Document accessibility support in user manual

## Implementation Details

### High Contrast Chart Theming

High contrast charts use the following color scheme:
- Background: #000000 (black)
- Primary elements: #FFFFFF (white)
- Secondary elements: #FFFF00 (yellow)
- Tertiary elements: #00FFFF (cyan)
- Success indicators: #00FF00 (green)
- Warning indicators: #FF8000 (orange)
- Danger/error indicators: #FF00FF (magenta)

These colors provide strong contrast and are distinguishable for most users with color vision deficiencies.

### Pattern Fills

For charts where color alone is not sufficient, we have implemented pattern fills using the patternomaly library. Pattern types include:
- Lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Dots
- Circles
- Crosses
- Checks

The patterns are applied automatically to pie, doughnut, bar, and polarArea charts when high contrast mode is enabled, making the charts more accessible to users with color vision deficiencies.

### State Persistence

User accessibility preferences are stored in localStorage under the key 'energy-audit-accessibility-settings' with the following structure:

```json
{
  "highContrastMode": boolean,
  "largeText": boolean,
  "reduceMotion": boolean,
  "screenReaderOptimization": boolean
}
```

## Technical Notes

1. Chart components access high contrast settings through nested context providers:
   - AccessibilitySettingsProvider (global settings)
   - ChartAccessibilityProvider (chart-specific settings)

2. High contrast mode is applied through:
   - CSS classes added to document root
   - Direct style overrides for chart configurations
   - Specific component props for accessibility
   - Pattern fills for charts using patternomaly

3. Performance considerations:
   - Theme changes should not trigger unnecessary re-renders
   - Settings are applied efficiently through context
   - Layout shifts are minimized when toggling modes
   - Pattern generation is optimized for performance
