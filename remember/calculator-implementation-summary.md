# Energy Audit Platform - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the recent improvements implemented in the Energy Audit Platform, focusing on addressing critical UI/UX issues, improving chart management, and implementing data persistence.

## UI/UX Improvements

### Schedule of Loads Calculator

#### Fixed Duplicate "Save Calculation" Buttons
- **Issue**: The calculator had duplicate "Save Calculation" buttons (one in the toolbar and one in the results section) with the same functionality, causing user confusion.
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed the redundant button from the main toolbar
  - Enhanced the remaining button with a descriptive tooltip
  - Changed the button to use the "contained" variant to make it more prominent
  - Consolidated all save functionality to one button to improve UX clarity

#### Fixed Chart Canvas Reuse Errors in Circuit Insights Dashboard
- **Issue**: The Circuit Insights Dashboard experienced "Canvas is already in use" errors when switching between charts or re-rendering the dashboard.
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented a comprehensive `chartManager` utility to handle Chart.js lifecycle
  - Added proper cleanup and destruction of chart instances
  - Implemented chart instance tracking to prevent canvas reuse issues
  - Added safeguards to check for existing chart instances before creating new ones
  - Created React hooks for Chart.js integration with proper lifecycle management
  - Fixed error in getChartInfo method to safely access Chart.js configuration
  - Added explicit chart destruction before creating new instances

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### CircuitInsightsDashboard.tsx

- **Issue**: The dashboard was experiencing errors with Chart.js canvas reuse and improper chart cleanup.
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed the chart cleanup by explicitly destroying charts before creating new ones
  - Added proper canvas checking and error handling when creating charts
  - Implemented theme-aware chart rendering that properly updates with theme changes
  - Fixed property access in the chartManager implementation to prevent type errors

### VoltageDropCalculator.tsx

- **Issue**: The calculator had incomplete implementations of key functionalities and linter errors.
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented the missing handleCalculate function to properly process voltage drop calculations
  - Added comprehensive handleReset functionality to properly clear state and notification handling
  - Implemented saveToSyncContext function to correctly synchronize with the Schedule of Loads calculator
  - Fixed parameter typing in the voltageDropInputsToUnifiedCircuit function call
  - Added proper handling of calculation results in the synchronization context
  - Enhanced error handling and user notifications throughout the calculator

## Data Persistence Implementation

### Calculator State Storage System

#### Storage Utility
- **Component**: `calculatorStateStorage.ts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Uses localStorage to persist calculator states between sessions
  - Implements proper type-safety with TypeScript generics
  - Provides separate storage for each calculator type
  - Handles both user-saved states and auto-saved drafts
  - Implements throttling to prevent excessive writes to localStorage

#### Auto-Save Feature
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses lodash's `debounce` function to throttle save operations (default: 2000ms)
  - Automatically saves calculator state as a draft during use
  - Separates draft states from user-explicitly-saved states
  - Only triggers after initial load and when meaningful changes are made

#### Recovery System
- **Component**: `CalculatorStateRecoveryDialog.tsx`
- **Functionality**:
  - Detects when a draft state exists for a calculator
  - Presents users with options to recover or discard drafts
  - Shows timestamp of when the draft was last modified
  - Provides clear UI with explanatory text about the recovery process
  - Integrates with the notification system for user feedback

## Integration with Calculators

### Schedule of Loads Calculator
- Added recovery dialog to detect unsaved work
- Implemented useEffect hooks to check for draft state on initial load
- Added auto-save integration to persist state during user edits
- Modified save functionality to clear draft state after explicit save
- Added user notifications for state recovery and persistence actions

### Voltage Drop Calculator
- Implemented similar data persistence pattern as Schedule of Loads Calculator
- Added auto-save functionality with proper throttling
- Created recovery dialog for unsaved work detection
- Modified existing save functionality to work with both the legacy system and new persistence layer
- Added UI/UX improvements for the save flow with a dedicated dialog

## Chart Management System

### Chart Manager Architecture
- **Component**: `chartManager.ts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Implements a singleton pattern for application-wide chart management
  - Provides methods for creating, updating, and destroying chart instances
  - Handles error cases like "Canvas is already in use" with automatic recovery
  - Tracks all chart instances with metadata for debugging and management
  - Ensures proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### React Integration Hooks
- **Component**: `useChart.ts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides React hooks for integrating charts with React components
  - Ensures proper cleanup when components unmount
  - Handles chart updates when dependencies change
  - Provides specialized hooks for different chart use cases
  - Simplifies chart integration with React's component lifecycle

### Chart Templates System
- **Component**: `chartTemplates.ts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Provides standardized chart configurations for common visualization types
  - Implements consistent styling across all chart types
  - Supports theme awareness with dark/light mode detection
  - Includes templates for bar, line, pie/doughnut, radar, scatter, and mixed charts
  - Automatically handles data formatting and styling based on chart type
  - Uses Material-UI theme colors for consistency with the application

### Theme-Aware Chart Hook
- **Component**: `useThemeAwareChart` in `useChart.ts`
- **Functionality**:
  - Automatically detects theme changes in the application
  - Rebuilds charts with appropriate colors when theme changes
  - Provides theme-specific styling for chart elements
  - Extracts colors from the Material-UI theme for consistent styling
  - Combines chart lifecycle management with theme awareness

## Technical Architecture

### Chart Management Architecture
- **Singleton Pattern**: Used for the chartManager to ensure chart instance tracking across the application
- **Observer Pattern**: Implements proper cleanup and event handling for chart lifecycle
- **Factory Pattern**: Provides a unified interface for chart creation with proper configuration

### Data Persistence Architecture
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts storage operations behind a clean API
- **Strategy Pattern**: Supports different storage strategies (localStorage now, server-side in future)
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds functionality like throttling and validation to base storage operations

## Future Work

### Short-Term
- Apply the data persistence pattern to other calculators
- Implement cross-calculator state synchronization
- Extend the chart manager to handle more visualization types
- Integrate the chart hooks into additional visualization components

### Medium-Term
- Add server-side persistence for sharing calculations between devices
- Implement batch operations for calculator states
- Add version management for calculator states

### Long-Term
- Implement a full synchronization system between client and server
- Add offline support with IndexedDB for larger datasets
- Implement a change history system for calculator states

## Conclusion

The implemented improvements address several critical UI/UX issues and significantly enhance the user experience by preventing data loss and improving chart rendering. The modular architecture of these solutions ensures they can be easily extended to other calculators in the platform. The implementation of both data persistence and chart management systems provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
