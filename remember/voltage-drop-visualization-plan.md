# Voltage Drop Visualization Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Enhance the existing voltage drop visualization to provide more comprehensive and interactive visualizations that help users understand voltage drop across circuits and make better decisions.

## Key Enhancements

1. **Interactive Voltage Profile Chart**
   - Chart showing voltage along the circuit length
   - Interactive tooltips with voltage at different points
   - Color-coding based on compliance status

2. **Conductor Comparison Visualization**
   - Side-by-side comparison of different conductor sizes
   - Visualization of cost vs. performance tradeoffs
   - ROI analysis for conductor upgrades

3. **Circuit Diagram Visualization**
   - Visual representation of the circuit with voltage drop indicators
   - Color-coded segments showing voltage drop severity
   - Interactive elements to modify circuit parameters

4. **Results Dashboard**
   - Comprehensive dashboard with multiple visualizations
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Export options for visualization data

## Implementation Approach

1. Enhance the VoltageDropVisualization component with multiple visualization modes
2. Create specialized chart components for each visualization type
3. Add interactive elements for user exploration
4. Implement data generators for each visualization

## Integration

1. Update VoltageDropAnalysisDialog to use enhanced visualization
2. Add new props for controlling visualization behavior
3. Implement event handlers for user interactions

## Timeline

- Interactive Voltage Profile: 1 hour
- Conductor Comparison: 1 hour
- Circuit Diagram: 1 hour
- Results Dashboard: 1 hour
- Integration: 1 hour

Total: 5 hours
