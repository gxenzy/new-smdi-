   - Bidirectional data conversion
   - Auto-sync capabilities
   - Basic conflict detection

2. **User Interface Components**
   - SynchronizationPanel with status indicators and controls
   - SyncHistoryDialog with filtering and visualization
   - Initial conflict resolution dialog
   - Settings management interface

3. **Integration with Calculators**
   - Voltage Drop Calculator integration
   - Schedule of Loads Calculator integration
   - Visual indicators for synchronized items

4. **Sync History System**
   - Event storage and management
   - Advanced filtering and pagination
   - Timeline visualization
   - CSV export

5. **Conflict Resolution System**
   - Advanced property-level conflict detection
   - Visual diff viewer for conflicts
   - Batch conflict resolution
   - Multiple resolution strategies
