# Lighting Power Density (LPD) Calculator Implementation

## Overview

The Lighting Power Density Calculator is a component for the Energy Audit Platform that allows users to assess the energy efficiency of lighting systems according to the Philippine Green Building Code standards.

   - Contains functions for calculating LPD and determining compliance
   - Handles the fetching and caching of standards data from the API
   - Includes building type presets for common scenarios
   - Provides energy savings calculations with ROI estimates

3. **Standards API Integration** (`standards.ts`):
   - Provides functions for fetching standards data from the server API
   - Includes caching mechanisms to reduce API calls
   - Handles error cases with fallback values to ensure the calculator works offline
   - Formats API data to match the expected structure used by the calculator

4. **Storage Utilities** (`storage.ts`):
   - Provides functions for saving and loading calculations from localStorage
   - Handles backward compatibility with legacy storage formats
   - Includes error handling for storage operations

5. **PDF Export** (`pdfExport.ts`):
   - Handles generation of PDF reports with calculation results
   - Creates data URLs for previewing reports within the application
   - Formats results with professional layout including tables and color coding

### Type Definitions

We've implemented strong typing throughout the application:

```typescript
// Core data types
export interface Fixture {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  wattage: number;
  ballastFactor: number;
  quantity: number;
}

export interface RoomData {
  name: string;
  area: number;
  buildingType: string;
  fixtures: Fixture[];
}

export interface LPDResult {
  totalWattage: number;
  lpd: number;
  isCompliant: boolean;
  standardLPD: number;
  buildingTypeLabel: string;
  recommendations: string[];
  potentialSavings?: EnergySavings;
}

// Energy savings calculation
export interface EnergySavings {
  wattageSavings: number;
  percentageSavings: number;
  complianceTarget: number;
  estimatedAnnualKwh: number;
  estimatedAnnualCost: number;
  paybackPeriod?: number;
}

// Presets
export interface BuildingPreset {
  name: string;
  buildingType: string;
  description: string;
  typicalRooms: RoomPreset[];
}

export interface RoomPreset {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  area: number;
  fixtures: Fixture[];
}

// API and standards types
export type BuildingStandardsType = Record<string, {label: string, maxLPD: number}>;
```

## UI Feature Highlights

1. **Building Type Presets**:
   - Dialog-based interface for selecting predefined building and room types
   - Detailed descriptions for each preset
   - Automatic fixture configuration based on selected room type
   - Instant application of preset data to the calculator

2. **Energy Savings Calculator**:
   - Optional calculation of potential energy savings
   - Configurable parameters for operation hours and energy costs
   - Upgrade cost input for payback period calculation
   - Visual representation of savings potential

## Design Patterns

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - UI logic in the React component
   - Calculation logic in utility functions
   - API interactions in dedicated service files

2. **Type Safety**:
   - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Strong typing for function parameters and return values

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Input validation with user-friendly error messages
   - Try-catch blocks for catching calculation and API errors
   - Fallback mechanisms for handling API failures

4. **Caching Strategies**:
   - In-memory caching for standards data
   - Cache expiry mechanisms for refreshing data
   - Cache clearing functionality for force-refreshing

## Standards Compliance

The calculator implements compliance checking based on the following standards:

- Philippine Green Building Code
- Philippine Electrical Code (PEC) 2017

## Testing Strategy

1. **Component Tests**: Verify rendering and user interactions
2. **Unit Tests**: Verify calculation accuracy and error handling
3. **Integration Tests**: Verify integration with the standards API and storage system
4. **Mock Tests**: Test API integration with mock data

## Documentation Updates

The calculator is documented in `lighting-power-density.md`, which includes:

- Calculation methodology
- Standards and compliance requirements
- Input requirements
- Result interpretation
- Energy efficiency recommendations

## Refactoring Work

The implementation includes refactoring of the existing code to:

1. Fix type errors in event handlers
2. Extract calculation logic to separate utility functions
3. Improve error handling with try-catch blocks
4. Add comprehensive unit tests for utility functions
5. Implement API integration for standards data
6. Add loading states and progress indicators
7. Enhance error display with user-friendly messages
8. Implement caching for API calls
