# Enhanced PDF Export Implementation Summary

## Recent Implementations (Schedule of Loads Calculator)

### Multi-Panel Support in PDF Export
We've enhanced the Schedule of Loads PDF export system to support multiple panels in a single comprehensive report. Key features include:

- **Table of Contents**: Automatically generates a TOC showing all panels included in the report
- **Executive Summary**: Provides aggregated statistics across all panels including:
  - Total connected load
  - Number of circuits
  - Phase balance statistics
  - Compliance rate
  - Panel breakdown with load distribution chart
- **Panel Divider Pages**: Clear separation between panels with summary information
- **Consistent Analysis Sections**: Each panel includes consistent analysis sections:
  - Load distribution visualization
  - Voltage drop analysis
  - Phase balance analysis (for 3-phase panels)
  - Compliance summary with PEC 2017 reference
  - Economic sizing analysis

### Schedule of Loads Calculator Improvements
We've addressed several user-reported issues with the Schedule of Loads calculator:

- **Fixed Edit Functionality**: Resolved TypeScript errors and fixed the edit button behavior
- **Added Proper Dropdown Selectors**: Implemented dropdown selectors for:
  - Circuit breaker sizes using standardized options (5A through 1200A)
  - Conductor sizes using standardized options (1.5mm² through 630mm²)
- **Fixed Economic Sizing Calculation**: Resolved the zero percent issue in economic sizing by:
  - Ensuring proper current values are passed to the analysis functions
  - Adding fallback values for circuit details to prevent calculation errors
  - Implementing better error handling for edge cases
  - Added clear visualization of economic sizing results
- **Added Save Button**: Implemented proper save calculation functionality with UI integration
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error reporting and recovery in PDF export
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Fixed TypeScript errors in several components

### Storage System Improvements
- **Fixed Storage Type Consistency**: Ensured consistent saving/loading with standardized type names
- **Improved Saved Calculation Viewer**: Enhanced the UI for viewing and selecting saved calculations
- **Added Error Handling**: Implemented better error messages when attempting to load incompatible calculation types

### Technical Improvements
- **Fixed Type Safety**: Resolved TypeScript errors in the PDF export system
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added better error reporting and recovery mechanisms
- **Project Info Interface**: Standardized project documentation format
- **Extended LoadItem Interface**: Created consistent interface for extended load data

## Cross-Calculator Integration

### Unified Calculation Storage System
We've enhanced the calculation storage system to work consistently across all calculators:

- **Standardized CalculatorType Identifiers**: Ensured consistent naming conventions for all calculator types
- **Improved Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces for stored calculations
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Added better error handling when retrieving saved calculations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Added support for legacy calculation formats

### Common UI Components
We've standardized several UI components that work across all calculators:

- **SavedCalculationsViewer**: Enhanced to work with all calculator types with proper filtering
- **Standardized Dialog System**: Implemented consistent dialog behavior for save/load operations
- **Unified Toolbar Layout**: Created consistent toolbar patterns with standardized buttons
- **Shared Visualization Components**: Developed reusable visualization components for data presentation

### Cross-Calculator Data Exchange
- **Implemented Circuit Data Exchange**: Added ability to share circuit data between calculators
- **Standardized Export Options**: Created consistent export options across calculators
- **Common Project Information**: Added shared project info that persists between calculators

## Next Steps

### 1. UI Integration for Multi-Panel Support
- Implement UI controls for selecting multiple panels to export
- Create a panel manager component to view/select available panels
- Add capability to reorder panels in the export

### 2. Further Schedule of Loads Enhancements
- Complete circuit breaker size recommendation system
- Implement automatic conductor sizing based on load requirements
- Add batch analysis for economic sizing across all circuits
- Implement typical load presets library for faster data entry

### 3. Extend Enhanced PDF Export to Other Calculators
- Apply the enhanced PDF export system to other calculators:
  - Lighting Calculator
  - HVAC Calculator
  - Power Factor Calculator
  - Harmonic Distortion Calculator
- Create a unified PDF export service for consistent implementation

### 4. Advanced PDF Features
- Implement customizable report sections
- Add user-configurable branding elements
- Implement batch export capabilities for multiple calculators
- Create comparison visualizations for before/after analysis

## Implementation Priority
1. Complete the UI integration for multi-panel support
2. Implement batch sizing optimization for all circuits
3. Add typical load presets library for faster data entry
4. Extend enhanced PDF export to other calculators
