# Batch Sizing Optimization Implementation

## Overview

The Batch Sizing Optimization feature allows users to optimize all circuits in a panel at once, providing recommendations for conductor sizes that balance compliance with economic considerations. This document outlines the implementation details and future enhancements.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **BatchSizingOptimizationDialog**
   - Dedicated dialog component for batch optimization
   - Configuration interface for economic and technical parameters
   - Results display with filtering and search capabilities
   - Options to apply individual or all optimizations

2. **Integration with ScheduleOfLoadsCalculator**
   - Added "Batch Sizing" button in the toolbar
   - State management for dialog visibility
   - Handling of optimization results

3. **Economic Analysis Features**
   - ROI calculation for conductor sizing decisions
   - Payback period estimation
   - Annual energy savings projection
   - Material cost estimation

4. **Compliance Features**
   - PEC 2017 compliance checking
   - Prioritization based on compliance status
   - Visual indicators for non-compliant circuits

### User Interface

The batch sizing optimization feature provides two main interfaces:

1. **Configuration Tab**
   - Panel information display
   - Economic parameters configuration (energy cost, operating hours, etc.)
   - Technical parameters configuration (voltage drop limits, safety factors)
   - Option toggles for prioritizing compliance vs. economics

2. **Results Tab**
   - Summary statistics (total circuits, non-compliant circuits, etc.)
   - Filtering options (high priority, positive ROI, etc.)
   - Detailed results table with circuit data and recommendations
   - Visual indicators for priority levels
   - Individual "Apply" buttons for selective optimization

### Key Features

- **Priority-based Recommendations**: Circuits are categorized as critical, high, medium, or low priority based on compliance status and economic factors
- **ROI Analysis**: Each recommendation includes ROI period calculation
- **Batch Application**: Option to apply all recommended optimizations at once
- **Selective Application**: Option to apply individual optimizations
- **Filtering System**: Filter results by priority, ROI period, etc.
- **Search Capability**: Search for specific circuits by description

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

1. User opens the BatchSizingOptimizationDialog from the ScheduleOfLoadsCalculator
2. User configures optimization parameters
3. User initiates optimization, which calls the optimizeAllCircuits function
4. Results are displayed in the Results tab
5. User can apply recommendations selectively or all at once
6. Updated circuit data is passed back to the ScheduleOfLoadsCalculator

### Key Functions

- **optimizeAllCircuits**: Processes all circuits in a load schedule for optimization
- **optimizeCircuit**: Analyzes a single circuit for optimization opportunities
- **handleApplyAllOptimizations**: Updates the load schedule with all recommended optimizations
- **handleApplySelectedOptimizations**: Updates only selected circuits
- **getFilteredResults**: Filters results based on search term and filter options

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visualization Enhancements**
   - Add chart visualization of potential savings
   - Create visual comparison of before/after voltage drop
   - Implement priority distribution pie chart

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Add custom filters for ROI periods
   - Implement sorting by different columns
   - Allow saving filter configurations

3. **PDF Export**
   - Create dedicated PDF export for optimization results
   - Include detailed economic analysis in exports
   - Add executive summary for management review

4. **Integration with Other Features**
   - Connect with voltage drop analysis for comprehensive assessment
   - Integrate with compliance reporting system
   - Link with multi-panel support for full system optimization

5. **Optimization Algorithms**
   - Implement advanced optimization algorithms for better recommendations
   - Add consideration for harmonic content in conductor sizing
   - Include temperature derating in optimization calculations

## Performance Considerations

For large panels with many circuits, the following optimizations have been implemented:

1. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates during optimization
2. **Throttled Processing**: Processing that doesn't block the UI
3. **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side filtering to quickly narrow down results
4. **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient table rendering for large datasets

## User Documentation

A brief guide for users:

1. Open the Schedule of Loads calculator
2. Click the "Batch Sizing" button in the toolbar
3. Configure optimization parameters in the Configuration tab
4. Click "Start Optimization" to analyze all circuits
5. Review results in the Results tab
6. Apply recommendations selectively or all at once using the provided buttons
