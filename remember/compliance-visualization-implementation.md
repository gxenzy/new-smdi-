# Compliance Visualization Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of compliance visualization components for the Energy Audit Platform, specifically focusing on voltage drop analysis. The components provide visual feedback on compliance status with electrical standards (primarily PEC 2017).

## Component Documentation

### ComplianceMeter Component

The `ComplianceMeter` component provides a circular gauge visualization for compliance status with the following features:

- Circular gauge with color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red) based on compliance level
- Animated transitions between values for a better user experience
- Threshold indicators showing compliance boundaries
- Detailed information display with compliance status and margin
- Configurable sizing (small, medium, large) for different contexts
- Interactive tooltips with additional information

#### Usage Example:

```tsx
<ComplianceMeter
  value={75.5}                   // Current value (0-100)
  threshold={80}                 // Minimum threshold for compliance
  label="Voltage Drop Compliance" // Label to display
  showDetails={true}             // Whether to show detailed information
  size="medium"                  // Size of the meter (small, medium, large)
  animated={true}                // Whether to animate transitions
  warningThreshold={85}          // Custom threshold for warning level
  description="PEC 2017 compliance" // Tooltip description
  onClick={() => handleClick()}  // Optional click handler
/>
```

### ComplianceVisualization Component

The `ComplianceVisualization` component provides a comprehensive visualization of compliance status with:

- ComplianceMeter gauge showing compliance level
- Detailed analysis of compliance margins and status
- Educational information about voltage drop and its importance
- References to relevant electrical standards (PEC 2017)
- Recommendations for improving compliance
- Interactive elements for navigating to standards documentation

#### Enhanced Features:

- Collapsible sections for recommendations and impact information
- Color-coded border around the compliance meter based on severity
- Critical issue indicator for severe compliance problems
- Circuit information display showing conductor, length, and current
- Formula display for voltage drop calculations
- Standards reference dialog with detailed code information
- Additional context-aware recommendations based on compliance status
- Equipment impact analysis showing operational effects of compliance/non-compliance
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

#### Usage Example:

```tsx
<ComplianceVisualization 
  circuitData={circuitData}
  voltageDropResult={calculationResults}
  showStandardsReferences={true}
  showEducationalInfo={true}
  onReferenceClick={(reference) => handleReferenceClick(reference)}
/>
```

## Integration Points

The compliance visualization components are integrated in:

1. **EnhancedVoltageDropAnalysisDialog**
   - Added as a new "Compliance" tab for detailed compliance analysis
   - Provides educational information alongside compliance status

2. **Voltage Drop Results Card**
   - ComplianceMeter added to quickly visualize compliance status
   - Replaced basic text indicators with visual gauge

## Technical Implementation

- Built with Material-UI components for consistent styling
- Fully responsive design works on all device sizes
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across components
- Uses React hooks for state management and animations
- Theme-aware styling that works with light/dark mode
- Collapsible sections to manage display density
- Dialog-based detailed information display
- Severity-based styling for critical issues
- Context-aware recommendations based on compliance status and margin
- Formula display with monospace formatting for clarity

## Implementation Notes

### Type Safety

The component correctly imports types from appropriate module files:
- `VoltageDropCalculationResult` from `./utils/voltageDropRecalculator`
- `UnifiedCircuitData` from `./utils/CircuitSynchronization`

### Contextual Recommendations

The component now provides different recommendations based on:
- Whether the circuit is compliant or non-compliant
- The margin of compliance (high, medium, low)
- The severity of non-compliance (critical, warning)

### Educational Content

The educational section now includes:
- Basic explanation of voltage drop concept
- Formulas for single-phase and three-phase voltage drop calculations
- Variable explanations for the formulas
- Visual formatting to improve readability

### Standards References

The standards references now include:
- Actual content from the PEC 2017 standard
- Dialog-based detailed view
- Link to full standard document
- Interactive elements for exploring standards
