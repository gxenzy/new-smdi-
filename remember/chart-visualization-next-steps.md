# Chart Visualization System - Recent Fixes & Next Steps

## Recent Fixes Implemented

### Chart Manager Utility

### Circuit Insights Dashboard

- Fixed chart re-rendering issues by adding explicit destruction of existing charts before creating new ones
- Implemented proper theme-aware chart rendering that updates correctly with theme changes
- Added cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks
- Fixed chart instance tracking to resolve the "Canvas already in use" error

### Voltage Drop Calculator

- Implemented synchronization with Schedule of Loads calculator
- Fixed error handling in calculation and chart rendering
- Improved data flow between calculators with proper type safety
- Enhanced user feedback with appropriate notifications

### New Chart Templates System

- Created standardized templates for common chart types:
  - Bar charts with support for stacking and horizontal orientation
  - Line charts with customizable styling and points
  - Pie/doughnut charts with legend positioning options
  - Radar charts for multi-dimensional data visualization
  - Scatter charts for X/Y coordinate data
  - Mixed charts that combine multiple chart types
- Implemented theme-aware styling that automatically adjusts to light/dark mode
- Added consistent color schemes that match the Material-UI theme
- Created proper TypeScript typing for all template functions
- Fixed type issues with borderWidth and borderDash properties in radar and line chart types

### Theme-Aware Chart Hooks

- Created `useThemeAwareChart` hook that automatically rebuilds charts when theme changes
- Extracted theme colors for consistent chart styling across the application
- Added dependency tracking to update charts when data or options change
- Implemented automatic chart cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Created example component showing the usage of various chart types

### Chart Utilities Export System

- Created centralized export file for all chart-related utilities
- Added helper functions to extract theme colors from Material-UI theme
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing for all exports
- Created simplified API for importing chart utilities

## Next Implementation Tasks for Chart Visualization System

  - [ ] Create reset view button for zoom reset
- [ ] Implement drill-down functionality:
  - [ ] Support for hierarchical data exploration
  - [ ] Click-to-expand data points
  - [ ] Breadcrumb navigation for drill-down history
- [ ] Add data filtering directly from chart UI:
  - [ ] Series toggle through legend clicks
  - [ ] Data point filtering through UI controls
  - [ ] Filter persistence between chart updates

### 5. Accessibility Enhancements (Priority: High)

- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation:
  - [ ] Arrow key navigation between data points
  - [ ] Tabbing between chart elements
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Add screen reader support:
  - [ ] ARIA attributes for chart elements

  - [ ] Announcements for data changes
- [ ] Create high-contrast mode:
  - [ ] Alternative color schemes for various vision needs
  - [ ] Pattern fills for colorblind users
  - [ ] Larger touch targets for motor impairments

### 6. Performance Optimization (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Implement data decimation for large datasets:
  - [ ] Automatic sampling for performance improvement
  - [ ] Level-of-detail rendering based on zoom level
  - [ ] Caching of processed data for faster renders
- [ ] Add throttling to real-time chart updates
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for multiple charts

## Technical Roadmap

1. Phase 1 (Complete): Chart manager and basic templates
2. Phase 2 (Current): React component library and advanced templates
3. Phase 3: Export functionality and interactive features
4. Phase 4: Accessibility enhancements and performance optimization

## Integration Plan

1. First Target: Refactor CircuitInsightsDashboard to use the new chart templates (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. Second Target: Update VoltageDropCalculator visualization to use the new chart system
3. Third Target: Extend to other calculators (Lighting, Power Factor, Harmonics)
