# Chart Accessibility Next Steps

## Current Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive accessibility testing framework for chart components, including:

1. **Core Accessibility Features**
   - Keyboard navigation for chart data points
   - Screen reader support with ARIA attributes
   - Data table alternatives for complex visualizations
   - Focus management for interactive elements
   - Keyboard shortcut help dialog

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Automated testing with axe-core
   - Manual testing recorder with structured test cases
   - Test report storage and management
   - Test analytics and visualization
   - Screen reader testing guides
   - Testing dashboard and roadmap for progress tracking

## Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Real-World Assistive Technology Testing

- [x] Create test recorder for documenting assistive technology test results
- [x] Create test reports management system
- [x] Create testing guides for screen readers
- [ ] Test with NVDA screen reader on Windows
  - Test keyboard navigation
  - Test data table view
  - Test chart summary announcements
  - Document findings
- [ ] Test with JAWS screen reader on Windows
  - Test in both virtual cursor and forms modes
  - Compare behavior with NVDA
  - Document any differences
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver on macOS (if available)
  - Test keyboard navigation with VO commands
  - Document differences from Windows screen readers
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode
  - Verify that charts remain legible
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast
  - Verify that patterns are distinguishable
- [ ] Document findings and necessary improvements
  - Create report of screen reader compatibility
  - Identify and prioritize issues to fix

### 2. Mobile Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Test with TalkBack on Android
  - Test touch navigation of charts
  - Verify that data points can be accessed
  - Document any mobile-specific issues
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver on iOS
  - Compare behavior with TalkBack
  - Document platform differences
- [ ] Test touch-based navigation for charts
  - Ensure charts can be explored via touch
  - Verify that data values are announced
- [ ] Adapt keyboard shortcuts for touch interfaces
  - Create touch-friendly alternatives to keyboard shortcuts
  - Implement swipe gestures where appropriate

### 3. Enhancements and Refinements

- [ ] Improve chart summary announcements with more detailed trend analysis
  - Add trend detection algorithms
  - Enhance summary text to include key insights
  - Add comparative analysis for multi-series charts
- [ ] Add support for more chart types
  - Bubble charts
  - Stacked bar charts
  - Area charts
  - Radar charts
  - Scatter plots
- [ ] Enhance high contrast mode patterns for better differentiation
  - Create more distinguishable patterns
  - Ensure patterns work well with high contrast mode
  - Test with users who have color vision deficiencies
- [ ] Add sonification options for charts
  - Implement audio representation of data
  - Allow users to hear data trends as sounds
  - Create controls for audio playback

### 4. Documentation Updates

- [ ] Create user-facing documentation for accessibility features
  - Document all keyboard shortcuts
  - Create tutorials for screen reader users
  - Provide guidance for mobile access
- [ ] Create developer guide for implementing accessible charts
  - Document best practices
  - Provide code examples
  - Create implementation checklist
- [ ] Document best practices for creating accessible data visualizations
  - Color choice guidelines
  - Pattern alternatives
  - Data complexity considerations
  - Alternative representation strategies

## Testing Priorities

Based on our implementation progress, the following testing priorities are recommended:

1. **High Priority**: Use ChartAccessibilityTestRecorder to document NVDA and keyboard-only testing on all chart types
2. **Medium Priority**: Use ChartAccessibilityTestRecorder to document JAWS testing and high contrast mode testing
3. **Lower Priority**: Test with VoiceOver and mobile screen readers

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (Completed)**
   - Core keyboard navigation features
   - Basic screen reader support
   - Testing infrastructure

2. **Phase 2 (Current)**
   - Comprehensive testing with assistive technologies
   - Issue documentation and prioritization
   - Initial refinements based on testing results

3. **Phase 3 (Upcoming)**
   - Fix identified issues from testing
   - Mobile accessibility enhancements
   - Support for additional chart types

4. **Phase 4 (Future)**
   - Advanced features like sonification
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - User testing and final refinements

## Action Items

1. Schedule testing sessions with NVDA and JAWS
2. Prioritize top issues from testing for immediate fixes
3. Update testing documentation with findings
4. Plan for mobile accessibility testing
5. Review and enhance existing keyboard navigation

By following this roadmap, we will ensure that our chart components are accessible to all users, regardless of ability or assistive technology used.
