## Technical Details

### Standards Integration
The calculator integrates with the application's standards API to fetch up-to-date LPD requirements based on building types. The implementation includes:

1. API integration with error handling and fallback values
2. In-memory caching to reduce API calls
3. TypeScript interfaces for standards data
4. Building type mapping for consistent labeling

### Calculation Logic
The core calculation functions are implemented in the lightingPowerDensityUtils.ts file:

1. `calculateTotalLightingPower` - Calculates total wattage for all fixtures
2. `calculateLPD` - Computes the lighting power density (W/m²)
3. `checkCompliance` - Verifies if the LPD meets standards requirements
4. `generateRecommendations` - Creates contextual recommendations
5. `calculateEnergySavings` - Estimates potential energy and cost savings
6. `calculateLPDResults` - Orchestrates the complete calculation workflow

### Energy Savings Calculation
The energy savings feature provides detailed insights:

1. Power savings (watts and percentage)
2. Annual energy consumption reduction (kWh)
3. Annual cost savings based on energy rate
4. Payback period calculation for fixture upgrades
5. Integration with recommendations for actionable insights

### PDF Export Implementation
PDF generation is handled through jsPDF and jspdf-autotable:

1. Professional document formatting with sections and headers
2. Fixtures table with detailed information
3. Results section with compliance status
4. Color-coded compliance information
5. Recommendations section with actionable insights
6. Energy savings section with financial metrics
7. Proper TypeScript declarations for type safety
