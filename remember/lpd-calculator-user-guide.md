# Lighting Power Density (LPD) Calculator User Guide

## Overview

The Lighting Power Density (LPD) Calculator is a tool that helps you evaluate the energy efficiency of lighting designs according to the Philippine Green Building Code standards. LPD is the amount of power used by lighting per unit of area, expressed in watts per square meter (W/m²). This guide will help you use the calculator effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the Energy Audit section of the platform
2. Select "Calculators" from the menu
3. Choose "Lighting Power Density Calculator" from the available calculators

## Using the Calculator

### Step 1: Enter Room Information

1. **Room Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the room or space
2. **Room Area**: Enter the floor area in square meters (m²)
3. **Building Type**: Select the appropriate building type from the dropdown menu

Each building type has a different maximum LPD limit according to standards. The current limit for the selected building type will be displayed below the dropdown.

### Step 2: Add Lighting Fixtures

1. Select a fixture type from the dropdown or choose "Custom Fixture" to define your own
2. For custom fixtures, enter a descriptive name
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Wattage**: The power rating of the fixture in watts (W)
   - **Ballast Factor**: The factor that adjusts the lamp power (typically between 0.8 and 1.2)
   - **Quantity**: The number of fixtures of this type
4. Click "Add Fixture" to add the fixture to your list

Repeat this process to add all lighting fixtures in the room. You can delete fixtures by clicking the trash icon next to the fixture in the list.

### Step 3: Calculate Results

1. Once you've added all fixtures, click the "Calculate LPD" button
2. The calculator will process your inputs and display the results

### Step 4: Review Results

The results section will show:

- **Total Lighting Power**: The sum of all fixture wattages (adjusted by ballast factors)
- **Lighting Power Density (LPD)**: The total lighting power divided by the room area
- **Compliance Status**: Whether your design meets the standard for the selected building type
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving your lighting design based on the results

### Step 5: Save Results (Optional)

If you want to save your calculation for future reference, click the "Save Results" button. The calculation will be stored in your account and can be accessed later from the saved calculations section.

## Understanding Inputs

### Fixture Types

- **LED Panel Light**: Modern, energy-efficient ceiling panel lights
- **T8 Fluorescent Tube**: Common tube fluorescent lamps, 32W standard
- **CFL Downlight**: Compact fluorescent lamps used in recessed ceiling fixtures
- **LED Spotlight**: Directional lights used for accent or task lighting
- **High-Bay LED**: High-power fixtures for spaces with high ceilings
- **T5 Fluorescent**: Smaller diameter, high-efficiency fluorescent tubes

### Ballast Factor

The ballast factor adjusts the lamp power based on the ballast used:
- Values less than 1.0 reduce the lamp power (energy-saving)
- Values equal to 1.0 provide the rated lamp power
- Values greater than 1.0 increase the lamp power (increased light output)

For LED fixtures without ballasts, use a factor of 1.0.

## Interpreting Results

### Compliance Status

Your lighting design will be marked as either:
- **Compliant**: Your LPD is at or below the standard for the selected building type
- **Non-Compliant**: Your LPD exceeds the standard and needs improvement

### Recommendations

Based on your results, the calculator will provide tailored recommendations such as:
- Switching to more efficient fixture types
- Reducing the number of fixtures
- Using task lighting instead of general lighting where appropriate
- Implementing lighting controls to reduce energy usage

## Standards Reference

The calculator uses the following standards for maximum LPD values:

| Building Type | Maximum LPD (W/m²) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Office        | 10.5              |
| Classroom     | 10.5              |
| Hospital      | 11.2              |
| Retail        | 14.5              |
| Industrial    | 12.8              |
| Residential   | 8.0               |
| Warehouse     | 8.0               |
| Restaurant    | 12.0              |
| Hotel         | 10.0              |
| Laboratory    | 14.0              |

These values are based on the Philippine Green Building Code and may be updated as standards change.
