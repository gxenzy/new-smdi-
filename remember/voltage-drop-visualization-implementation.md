# Voltage Drop Visualization Implementation

## Progress Summary

We have started implementing enhanced visualizations for voltage drop analysis, beginning with the VoltageProfileChart component.

## Implemented Features

### 1. VoltageProfileChart Component

The VoltageProfileChart provides a visual representation of voltage levels throughout the length of a circuit, helping users identify where voltage drop becomes problematic.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive line chart showing voltage vs. distance
- Color-coded sections indicating compliant and non-compliant areas
- Reference lines for maximum allowable voltage drop and supply voltage
- Interactive tooltips showing detailed information at each point
- Dynamic data generation based on circuit parameters
- Theme-aware styling for consistent appearance

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
export function generateVoltageProfileData(
  circuitData: UnifiedCircuitData,
  voltageDropResult: VoltageDropCalculationResult,
  numberOfPoints: number = 20
): VoltageProfileData[] {
  const supplyVoltage = circuitData.voltage || 230;
  const conductorLength = circuitData.conductorLength || 10;
  const voltageDrop = voltageDropResult.voltageDrop;
  const maxAllowedDrop = voltageDropResult.maxAllowedDrop;
  
  // Calculate maximum voltage drop as a percentage
  const maxVoltageDrop = (maxAllowedDrop / 100) * supplyVoltage;
  
  // Generate data points along the conductor length
  const data: VoltageProfileData[] = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= numberOfPoints; i++) {
    const distanceRatio = i / numberOfPoints;
    const distance = distanceRatio * conductorLength;
    
    // Calculate voltage at this point (assuming linear voltage drop)
    const voltageAtPoint = supplyVoltage - (voltageDrop * distanceRatio);
    
    // Check if voltage is compliant at this point
    const minimumAllowedVoltage = supplyVoltage - maxVoltageDrop;
    const isCompliant = voltageAtPoint >= minimumAllowedVoltage;
    
    data.push({
      distance,
      voltage: voltageAtPoint,
      isCompliant
    });
  }
  
  return data;
}
```

### 2. Integration with EnhancedVoltageDropAnalysisDialog

We have integrated the VoltageProfileChart into the EnhancedVoltageDropAnalysisDialog component to provide users with detailed voltage drop visualization.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Added VoltageProfileChart to the results tab
- Implemented proper data passing from voltage drop calculation results
- Added interactive features for inspecting specific points on the profile
- Ensured consistent styling with the rest of the application

**Implementation Details:**
```tsx
<Box sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
  {calculationResults && circuitData && (
    <VoltageProfileChart
      circuitData={circuitData}
      voltageDropResult={{
        ...calculationResults
      }}
      showReferenceLine={true}
      interactive={true}
      height={300}
      onPointHover={(distance, voltage) => {
        console.log(`Voltage at ${distance}m: ${voltage}V`);
      }}
    />
  )}
</Box>
```

### 3. Conductor Comparison Utilities and Chart

We have successfully implemented the conductor comparison utilities and chart components, which allow users to compare different conductor sizes and their impact on voltage drop, power loss, and costs.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-series comparison of different conductor sizes
- Economic analysis for each conductor size option
- Side-by-side comparison with key metrics
- Cost/benefit analysis with payback period calculation
- Visualization of compliant vs. non-compliant options
- Interactive selection of conductor sizes

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
export function generateConductorComparisonData(
  baseCircuitData: UnifiedCircuitData,
  alternativeSizes: string[] = [],
  operatingHoursPerYear: number = 2000,
  energyCostPerKwh: number = 0.12
): Record<string, ConductorComparisonData> {
  // Generate comparison data for different conductor sizes
  // Calculate voltage drop, power loss, material costs, etc.
  // Return structured data for visualization
}

export function recommendOptimalConductorSize(
  baseCircuitData: UnifiedCircuitData,
  operatingHoursPerYear: number = 2000,
  energyCostPerKwh: number = 0.12
): { size: string; reason: string } {
  // Find recommended conductor size based on technical and economic factors
  // Consider compliance, power loss, and economic payback period
  // Return recommendation with explanation
}
```

**Integration Details:**
```tsx
<ConductorComparisonChart
  circuitData={circuitData}
  currentConductorSize={currentSize}
  alternativeSizes={alternativeSizes}
  comparisonData={comparisonData}
  onSizeSelect={(size) => handleSizeSelect(size)}
  height={400}
/>
```

### 4. Circuit Diagram Visualization

- SVG-based rendering with responsive scaling
- Animation for current flow visualization
- Interactive tooltips and clickable components
- Multiple visualization modes (voltage, current, power loss)
- Zoom and pan capabilities for detailed inspection

**Implementation Details:**

export interface CircuitDiagramProps {
  circuitData: UnifiedCircuitData;
  voltageDropResult: VoltageDropCalculationResult;
  highlightMode?: 'voltage' | 'current' | 'power';
  showAnimation?: boolean;
  animationSpeed?: number;
